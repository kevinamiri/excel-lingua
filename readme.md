# Batch Processing with Backoff Algorithm for GPT-4 API (OpenAI)

This repository offers an implementation of the backoff algorithm for the OpenAI API, particularly designed for batch processing to prevent [rate limit errors](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/error-mitigation). The backoff algorithm helps manage API request rates and ensures your application gracefully handles rate limit errors from the OpenAI API. We used GPT-4 for translation tasks and XLSX for data management instead of pandas or databases.

## Overview

The backoff algorithm manages API request rates. When the API returns an error due to exceeding the rate limit, the algorithm progressively increases the wait time between requests. This allows the application to continue making requests efficiently during limited intervals between errors.

This implementation supports batch processing, which greatly enhances efficiency and performance when handling large volumes of data.

## Features

- **Backoff Algorithm:** Uses Exponential Backoff Algorithm with Jitter, progressively increasing wait time between requests when encountering rate limit errors while introducing random elements (jitter) to avoid synchronization issues.
- **Batch Processing:** Supports batch processing for efficient processing of large data volumes. Batch size can be easily adjusted.
- **Translation with GPT-4:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4 API for translation tasks.
- **Data Management with XLSX:** Handles data in Excel format instead of using databases or pandas for easy and efficient data management.
- **TypeScript Support:** Written in TypeScript for static typing and other features promoting robust and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up your OpenAI API key. Start making requests to the OpenAI API, and the backoff algorithm will automatically handle rate limit errors. Refer to the repository's README for detailed instructions on using this implementation.

This implementation efficiently interacts with ChatGPT or chat completions, managing API requests efficiently when processing large data volumes with rate limit errors.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met:

* Node.js and npm installed.
* Basic understanding of TypeScript or using this script for translation tasks.
* OpenAI API key.

### Installation Guide

Follow the step-by-step guide provided in the original markdown response to install Node.js, npm, and this application on a Windows system.

### Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Application

Run the application using:

```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```
